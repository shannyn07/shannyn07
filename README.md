## Writer Bio ⌨
My name is Shannon and I'm an experienced technical writer with over 6 years of working in different teams creating materials from SOPs to marketing copy. I have a strong background in analysis and research with experience working on a product team in an agile environment.

I'm a fast learner with just enough chops to figure out the technical side of documentation for both internal and external audiences.

📝 This repo houses two writing samples, but please contact me for more at shannyn07@gmail.com.
