## âŒ¨ Writer Bio 
My name is Shannon and I'm an experienced technical writer with over 7 years of working in different teams creating materials from SOPs to marketing copy. I have a strong background in analysis and research with experience working on a product team in an agile environment.

I'm a fast learner with just enough technical chops to figure out what's necessary to document for both internal and external audiences.
