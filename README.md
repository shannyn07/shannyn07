## âŒ¨ Writer Bio 
My name is Shannon and I'm an experienced technical writer with over 7 years of working in different teams creating materials from SOPs to marketing copy. I have a strong background in analysis and research with experience working on a product team in an agile environment.

I'm a fast learner with just enough technical chops to figure out what's necessary to document for both internal and external audiences.

This repo houses two writing samples, but please contact me for more at shannyn07@gmail.com.
